          <p>
            At Shumba, we believe true wealth comes from more than money in the
            bank. It includes financial independence, community and the freedom
            to express yourself. That's why we founded Shumba Money - to provide
            fashion, finances and community that unlock a richer life for all
            Zimbabweans, regardless of background.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here you'll find trendy style at fair prices, financial tools that
            build real wealth and a community that inspires each member to be
            their most authentic self. Our products are just the beginning. The
            real transformation happens within each person who joins our family,
            as aspirations become reality through the power of community,
            finances that work for you and fashion that expresses your true
            self.
          </p>
          <p>
            Walk with us on our journey to create a Zimbabwe where what's within
            each person - their spirit, talent and unique perspective - has the
            opportunity to flourish. You belong here.

            <p>
              Shumba Money started with a simple but radical idea: that
              Zimbabweans deserved access to financial services, fashion and
              community on their own terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was founded in 2020 by a group of passionate individuals who
              saw the need for a platform that seamlessly integrates various
              services under one roof. With a combined experience of over 10
              years in the industry, our team is dedicated to providing
              innovative solutions that cater to the diverse needs of our
              customers.We launched with three key services that aimed to uplift
              the financial, emotional and social wellbeing of Zimbabweans:

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Since then we've expanded to offer event planning, fashion
              consultation, entertainment packages, marketing solutions and more
              - each innovation guided by our vision to positively transform
